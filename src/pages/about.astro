        <p class='quote-body'>
          The octopus is a perfect representation of the existence and purpose
          of this community! Octopuses are one of the most intelligent ocean
          creatures, and they learn and adapt very quick.

          Its symbolism pretty much encapsulates what we‚Äôre about. Selflessness,
          intelligence, awareness, altruism, the ability to overcome challenging
          solutions with creativity and intelligence.

          Everything we do is open source. Our content is open source. Our
          website is open source. Our projects are open source. Why? Because
          reading and understanding other people‚Äôs code makes you a better
          coder. Because networking and collaborating with other people make you
          a better human.

          experimenting and creating things.

          We understand that behind every username or profile picture is a
          learner and a passionate individual. So, kindness, respect, and
          altruism are the pillars that define us as the creatures we are. We
          don‚Äôt step on each other‚Äôs feet, or gate-keep our ideas. It‚Äôs who we
          are both inside and outside of this community. We care deeply about
          each other's well-being, even if we don‚Äôt know each other personally.

        <p class='quote-body'>
          We get excited about code, and want to scream out our excitement. Our
          motivation is intrinsic. We like to share our findings with the rest
          of the community. We like to give feedback as much as we like to get
          feedback. We‚Äôre not afraid to get our hands dirty. We‚Äôre practical
          creatures. We like to solve our problems using creativity and
          intelligence.
